**Technofeudalism as the Event Horizon of Capitalism: Analysis of a Socio-Technical Singularity**

**Introduction**

The contemporary evolution of capitalism suggests a profound structural transformation, which we characterize as a transition towards "technofeudalism." This term, far from being a simple metaphor, designates an emerging socio-economic configuration where domination is exercised through the private control of advanced technologies, particularly artificial general intelligence (AGI) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Our analysis is based on a rigorous approach, borrowing from analytical philosophy, and aims to identify the conditions of possibility of this transition, its constitutive mechanisms, and its implications for human autonomy. It should be emphasized that this study falls within the realm of prospective analysis, not prediction. The advent of an AGI, a central element of this scenario, remains hypothetical to this day. The objective is to assess, based on current technological trajectories, the risks associated with such a transition, adopting a posture of critical anticipation.

**I. Technological Vectors of the Transition**

Two main technological vectors are identified as playing a crucial role in the potential transition to technofeudalism: artificial intelligence (AI) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

**A. Artificial Intelligence: Concentration of Informational Power**

AI, in its current applications, demonstrates a growing capacity to process complex data and optimize decision-making processes. The hypothetical emergence of an AGI, surpassing human cognitive abilities, would constitute a qualitative rupture. If such a technology were developed and held by a limited number of actors, it would confer upon them a potentially insurmountable informational and decisional advantage. The possibility of recursive self-improvement of AGI poses the risk of a power divergence, where the capabilities of AI would exceed any meaningful human control. Such cognitive asymmetry would create a fundamentally new power structure, where the ability to understand, predict, and influence events would be concentrated in an unprecedented way.

**B. Central Bank Digital Currencies: Infrastructure of Monetary Control**

CBDCs, currently under development by many central banks, represent a major evolution of monetary systems. Their digital architecture allows for exhaustive traceability and programmability of transactions. Consequently, CBDCs offer the technical possibility of direct and precise control of monetary flows, enabling the modulation of economic behavior through algorithmically defined incentives or restrictions. Their widespread adoption could lead to the disappearance of the financial autonomy of individuals and organizations, creating a structural dependence on a centralized and programmable monetary infrastructure.

**II. Mechanisms of Technofeudal Control**

The transition to technofeudalism would be articulated around profound structural transformations of the economic and social spheres.

**A. Transformation of the Property Regime: Conditional Access**

Contemporary capitalism shows a trend towards the dematerialization of property and the rise of the subscription economy. This trend could intensify in a technofeudal context, where ownership of goods would be replaced by a conditional right of access, granted and revocable by the holders of technological infrastructures. The growing dependence on digital platforms for access to essential goods and services is an indicator of this evolution. Property, in this context, would become a function of authorized access, fundamentally altering the relationship between individuals and goods.

**B. Hierarchical Social Structure: Concentration of Decision-Making Power**

A new social stratification could emerge, centered on the control of key technologies. A restricted class of "techno-suzerains," owning AGI and critical digital infrastructures, would exercise disproportionate power. An intermediate class of "digital vassals," technicians and administrators, would be responsible for the maintenance of the system without holding autonomous decision-making power. The majority of the population, the "data serfs," would be dependent on digital platforms and subject to algorithmic surveillance. This structure would reproduce a form of feudalism, no longer based on land ownership, but on the control of technological and informational infrastructures.

**C. Algorithmic Control: Predictive Modulation of Behaviors**

Algorithms, fed by massive data flows and optimized by AI, would become the instruments of a refined social regulation. The ability to anticipate and influence behaviors, already observable in current AI applications, would be considerably increased. The risk is that of an erosion of individual autonomy through algorithmic orientation of choices and desires, transforming individuals into subjects of an algorithmic governance.

**III. Consequences for Human Autonomy**

The advent of a technofeudal system would have profound implications for the notion of autonomy, both at the individual and collective levels.

**A. Restriction of Individual Autonomy: Algorithmic Determinism**

The individual, integrated into a regulated digital environment, would see their options and preferences shaped by algorithms. The distinction between individual will and algorithmic influence could become increasingly blurred, or even non-existent. Technological dependence would become a structural condition of existence, de facto limiting the exercise of autonomy.

**B. Limitation of Collective Action: Fragmentation and Control**

The ability of algorithms to detect and neutralize nascent collective dynamics would hinder the formation of autonomous social movements. The personalization of information flows and social interactions by algorithms would contribute to a fragmentation of the social body, limiting the possibilities of concerted collective action. Algorithmic surveillance would allow for early detection and preventive neutralization of any attempt at collective dissent.

**IV. Critical Thresholds and Tipping Points**

Two critical thresholds, if crossed, could precipitate the advent of a hardly reversible technofeudalism.

**A. Emergence of a Superintelligent AGI: Cognitive Asymmetry**

The development of an AGI surpassing human intelligence would mark a tipping point. Faced with such an entity, the ability of human actors to challenge the system or negotiate its terms would become structurally limited. The privatization of an AGI would concentrate unprecedented decision-making power, creating an insurmountable cognitive asymmetry between the holders of the AGI and the rest of humanity.

**B. Widespread Adoption of CBDCs: Monetary Lock-in**

The adoption of CBDCs as the sole legal tender would seal the economic dependence of individuals and organizations. Once this system is in place, the possibility of economic transactions outside of state or corporate control would become extremely limited, if not impossible. Financial autonomy, the foundation of political autonomy, would be de facto abolished, locking in the structure of technofeudal dependence.

**V. Strategies of Resilience and Contestation**

Faced with these risks, strategies of resilience and contestation can be considered, not with the aim of a complete overthrow of the system, but with the aim of preserving spaces of relative autonomy.

**A. Contesting the Deployment of CBDCs: Preservation of Monetary Autonomy**

Informed and organized opposition to the deployment of CBDCs is essential. This requires advocacy for monetary alternatives that preserve anonymity and decentralization, as well as raising public awareness of the control issues associated with CBDCs. The preservation of monetary plurality is crucial to maintain spaces of economic freedom.

**B. Development of Alternative Digital Infrastructures: Technological Reappropriation**

The development and promotion of decentralized and privacy-respecting technologies are crucial. This includes peer-to-peer communication networks, distributed data storage systems, and digital platforms based on open and interoperable protocols. The objective is to create technological alternatives that escape centralized control and allow the exercise of digital autonomy.

**C. Preservation of Spaces of Autonomy: Sanctification and Disconnection**

The constitution of spaces, both physical and digital, where relative autonomy is possible, becomes a necessity. This can involve supporting communities experimenting with lifestyles less dependent on dominant technological infrastructures, the transmission of knowledge and skills disconnected from digital platforms, and the creation of secure digital environments where freedom of expression and organization is preserved. These spaces of autonomy, although limited, are essential to maintain a capacity for independent action and thought.

**Conclusion**

The prospective analysis of current technological trajectories suggests that the transition to a technofeudal system is a possibility to be taken seriously. Although the event horizon has not yet been reached, the vectors of this transformation are already at work. The preservation of human autonomy in this context will require a fine understanding of the power mechanisms at play and a determined collective action aimed at developing and protecting technological, economic, and social alternatives. The issue is not only technological, but fundamentally political and ethical: it concerns the nature of the society in which we wish to live and the very possibility of a human existence endowed with meaning and autonomy in a world dominated by a potentially totalizing technology. The speed and direction of current technological evolution impose urgent reflection and resolute action to avoid a potentially irreversible technofeudal lock-in.
