### **The Risks of "Technological Guardianship": An In-Depth Analysis**

"Technological guardianship" refers to the growing dependence of individuals and organizations on technologies to perform cognitive or decision-making tasks. While these tools offer advantages in terms of efficiency and speed, they pose significant risks related to the erosion of individual and collective cognitive abilities. This article explores these risks by drawing on scientific research and empirical studies, while also proposing ways to mitigate their effects.

---

## **I. Effects of Technological Guardianship on Individuals**

### 1. **Individual Cognitive Atrophy**
Studies show that the excessive use of technologies such as GPS, chatbots, or online search tools can lead to a decline in certain cognitive abilities, including:
- **Spatial memory**: Regular GPS users show reduced hippocampal activity, which is essential for navigation and spatial memory. This can lead to a gradual loss of the ability to create mental maps and navigate without technological assistance[2][6][13].
- **Critical thinking and problem-solving**: Dependence on automated systems to provide answers or solutions can reduce active engagement in reasoning, thus limiting the development of analytical skills[4][10].
- **Learning abilities**: By outsourcing cognitive tasks (such as remembering information or solving problems), individuals may use their brains less, which can weaken their overall learning abilities[14][11].

### 2. **Loss of Cognitive Autonomy**
Technological guardianship can also diminish cognitive autonomy, defined as the ability to think and decide for oneself. Research on the excessive use of chatbots or algorithms shows that:
- Users tend to passively accept technological recommendations without questioning them[24][37].
- The lack of active engagement in cognitive processes can reduce self-confidence and increase feelings of inadequacy when faced with complex tasks[4][10].

### 3. **Psychological Impact**
The erosion of cognitive abilities is often accompanied by negative psychological effects, such as:
- Increased stress and anxiety when technology fails or becomes unavailable[11].
- A diminished sense of personal accomplishment related to autonomous problem-solving[4].

## **II. Effects on Organizational Structures**

### 1. **Loss of Organizational Memory**
Organizations that rely heavily on automated systems risk losing their collective memory, especially when:
- Key processes are outsourced to digital tools without adequate documentation[16][34].
- Employee departures result in an irreversible loss of tacit knowledge not captured in the systems[34].

This loss is exacerbated by the phenomenon known as "organizational deskilling," where human skills necessary for certain processes disappear due to lack of regular use.

### 2. **Risk of Cognitive Homogenization**
Automated technologies tend to standardize decision-making processes, which can:
- Reduce cognitive diversity within teams by promoting algorithmic conformism[8][38].
- Limit innovation by preventing the exploration of unconventional or creative solutions[27].

### 3. **Systemic Dependence**
An organization that is overly dependent on its technological tools becomes vulnerable to technical failures or rapid changes in its environment. For example:
- Automated systems can reproduce or amplify existing biases in the data used for their training, thus compromising the quality of decisions made[5][36].
- A critical technological failure can paralyze an entire operational chain if no human alternative is available[19].

---

## **III. Parallels between Individuals and Organizations**

The effects observed at the individual level are mirrored at the organizational level:
| Individual Level | Organizational Level |
|---|---|
| Loss of spatial memory due to GPS | Loss of organizational memory due to excessive outsourcing |
| Reduction in critical reasoning with chatbots | Decision-making standardization via algorithms |
| Personal cognitive dependence | Organizational systemic dependence |

These parallels highlight that the same underlying mechanisms (cognitive outsourcing, active disengagement) affect both individuals and collective structures.

---

## **IV. Strategies to Mitigate Risks**

### 1. **Cognitive Rehabilitation**
To counter individual cognitive atrophy:
- Encourage active and critical use of technologies (e.g., using GPS while simultaneously trying to memorize the route)[12].
- Integrate cognitive exercises into daily life (navigation without technological assistance, stimulating games)[11].

### 2. **Strengthening Organizational Memory**
To prevent the loss of collective knowledge:
- Implement robust knowledge management systems that capture not only explicit data but also tacit knowledge through mentoring or collaborative storytelling[16][30].
- Encourage systematic and accessible documentation of critical processes.

### 3. **Cognitive Diversification**
To limit algorithmic homogenization:
- Foster cognitive diversity in teams (varied profiles, interdisciplinary perspectives)[38].
- Introduce a critical human step in all automated processes to validate or challenge algorithmic recommendations[24].

### 4. **Development of a Reflexive Culture**
Organizations must cultivate metacognitive vigilance to identify their own biases and technological dependencies:
- Regularly organize cognitive audits to assess the impact of technologies on their internal processes[16][37].
- Train their employees to understand not only how to use these technologies but also how they influence their decisions.

## **V. Conclusion**

Technological guardianship is an ambivalent phenomenon: it can improve our performance while making us vulnerable in the long term if not used with discernment. Through a proactive and balanced approach, it is possible to exploit its advantages while minimizing its risks.

To do this, it is essential to:
1. Maintain a balance between human autonomy and technological assistance.
2. Preserve and enrich both individual and collective cognitive abilities.
3. Design systems where humans and machines truly collaborate, rather than blindly delegating our critical faculties.

Ultimately, it is not simply a matter of adopting these technologies but of redefining our relationship with them so that they serve our objectives without compromising our autonomy or our collective intellectual resilience.
