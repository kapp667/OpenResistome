### Thinking About "Value" in the Age of AI: Towards Organizational Plasticity
*Strategic reflection on the cognitive resilience of SMEs in the face of technological disruption*

---

**The rise of AI** is already profoundly transforming production methods, sought-after skills, and more broadly, the entire economy. By 2025, the widespread adoption of generative AI (Gemini 2.0, multimodal hyper-assistants, etc.) is no longer a mere fantasy but an unavoidable reality. Large groups, equipped with R&D teams and massive resources, have the advantage of exploring the possibilities of these tools upstream—and capturing weak signals very early on. SMEs, on the other hand, face the same disruption with fewer resources and a more direct exposure to innovation cycles that can shake their foundations.

**However, the stakes are not simply financial**. It is no longer a question of determining how many euros will be gained or saved thanks to AI, but rather of understanding how the company can **reinvent itself** in the face of rapid, unpredictable, and sometimes brutal changes. In this context, the idea of classic "return on investment" (ROI) loses its relevance: what matters is **resilience** and organizational **plasticity**, that is, the ability of the SME to learn, transform, and pivot without losing its identity.

### Organizational Plasticity: At the Heart of Resilience

**Organizational plasticity** is a faculty that echoes what is called, in humans, "cognitive resilience": the ability to absorb shocks, learn from experience, and reorient oneself quickly. In the business world, this translates into the ability to redefine internal culture, working methods, and strategic positioning while maintaining long-term coherence.

When technological innovation unfolds at an exponential rate, SMEs must develop a **culture of exploration** and **test-and-learn**: launch pilots, accept the possibility of failure, draw concrete lessons, and move faster than the competition. The most agile companies are often those that value the versatility of their teams, the fluidity in the circulation of ideas, and the hybridization of skills.

### Moving from the Paradigm of Competence to the Paradigm of Cognitive Agility

For a long time, companies structured their workforce according to **fixed positions** and **skills**. In the age of AI, this model may prove too rigid. The arrival of new technologies—sometimes in total rupture with the existing ones—requires instead "modular missions", continuous training dynamics, and occasional rotation of roles, allowing to **weave a collective intelligence** network.

In this context, the IT manager can very well join a working group on digital pedagogy, while a trainer will get involved in technological monitoring. This exchange of knowledge and expertise stimulates creativity and **prepares the ground** for the adoption of new AI tools, even when they emerge unexpectedly.

### Facing the Giants: The Strength of Responsiveness and Field Proximity

For small and medium-sized structures, the challenge is also that of **speed**: large groups are often informed upstream of major trends and can invest heavily in the acquisition or creation of advanced technologies. SMEs do not have these financial resources or privileged access, and sometimes find themselves facing a fait accompli.

However, their strength lies in their **responsiveness** and their **capacity for co-innovation**. Where a CAC 40 group will take several months to validate a pilot internally, an SME can decide in a few days to test an AI model applied to its business, mobilize the entire department on a short sprint, and draw immediate lessons. It is this agility that guarantees a form of "accelerated resilience," where rapid decision-making becomes a strategic advantage.

### Rethinking "Value": The Learning Adventure

One of the major paradigm shifts lies in the way of measuring the "value" created by the company. Instead of understanding it solely through profitability on a particular project, it is necessary to take into account the **learning dynamic** and the **speed of iteration**.

-   **Iteration value** refers to the company's ability to experiment, fail fast, and redirect effort without flinching.
-   **Learning value** concerns the way the organization takes advantage of each experience—good or bad—to consolidate a base of reusable knowledge, subsequently feeding other projects.

By relying on these values, the SME builds a **collective knowledge** that exceeds the sum of individual skills, paving the way for emerging innovations and timely adaptations.

### Innovating Serenely: From Ethics to Culture

With the spread of AI also arise ethical questions: collection and use of data, automation of sensitive tasks, preservation of the human link... SMEs, closer to their teams and their customers, are well-placed to build an **ethical narrative** around the adoption of AI: explain why and how technology is used, involve staff in technical choices, reflect on the place of human creativity in training or production.

This ethical commitment can become a strong marker of the **corporate culture**. It also contributes to internal coherence: adapting to upheavals, yes, but without distorting its founding values. It is a way of reassuring both the teams and the external stakeholders, while affirming a distinctive positioning in the face of the giants, sometimes perceived as too focused on short-term profitability.

### Conclusion: Building Your Own Story in the Face of Disruption

As AI spreads across all sectors, the question is no longer just whether an SME can afford to invest in a particular tool, but **how it can transform itself** to remain relevant tomorrow. It is not the promise of a double-digit ROI that will make the difference, but rather the ability to **absorb the unknown**, to **learn relentlessly**, and to **preserve a coherent narrative** around its identity.

In this sense, **organizational plasticity** constitutes the very future of SMEs in 2025. It is this that will give teams the strength and enthusiasm necessary to experiment with AI—sometimes to suffer its limits—and then bounce back, stronger and more innovative. Far from being a strict financial variable, this plasticity is akin to **adaptability capital**: a form of collective cognitive competitiveness, which opens the way to permanent invention rather than simple survival.

In the end, it is about writing your own story, remaining **attentive** to major technological breakthroughs without losing contact with the human, ethical, and cultural aspects that make each SME unique. The equation that arises is not "how much does it bring in?", but rather "who do we know how to become?"—a powerful question, the answer to which will trace, for each company, a unique path to the future.
