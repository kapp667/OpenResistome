## 1. Context and Evolution of Social Capital

Today, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of co-intelligence practices are transforming how expertise is created, evaluated, and disseminated. Social capital ‚Äì traditionally defined as the set of relationships, trust, and symbolic resources of an organization ‚Äì is subject to new dynamics:

- **Democratization of Expertise:** Generative AI allows a very broad audience to perform tasks previously reserved for specialists. Technical expertise is no longer a rare asset but an easily accessible flow of information.
- **Reconfiguration of Value Networks:** Collaborative platforms and co-intelligence architectures promote a fluid circulation of knowledge, enabling faster and more flexible cooperation [1].
- **Renegotiation of Legitimacy:** In this new ecosystem, human added value must be asserted other than by mere technical mastery, while AI and its contributions must also gain legitimacy in collective decision-making processes.

*Consequence:* Social capital, historically based on the monopoly of expertise and trust in a brand or a leader, must be redefined around new criteria such as the ability to orchestrate co-intelligence, mobilize hybrid communities (humans + AI), and manage the distributed flow of knowledge [1].

---

## 2. Mapping of New Forms of Social Capital

### 2.1 Coordination Capital

With the proliferation of hybrid systems and the co-presence of human actors and AI, an organization's ability to **coordinate** its members and artificial agents effectively becomes a strategic asset.
- **Inter-human and AI Coordination:** Tacit knowledge and understanding of group dynamics, coupled with intelligent orchestration of AI tools, foster the emergence of a *resilient collective intelligence* [1].
- **Transparency Capital:** Distributed networks require a high level of transparency to maintain trust; what was once a "plus" becomes a heresy if it is not ensured.

### 2.2 Shared Experience Capital

Shared learning, whether through participatory workshops, *structured brainstorming*, or **partnership intelligence exercises**, strengthens informal ties within the ecosystem:
- **Co-creation and Knowledge Sharing:** Organizations that facilitate the aggregation of field experience and the valorization of collective intuition create a "shared experience capital" that is more difficult to imitate [1].
- **Relational Brand:** Being recognized as a hub for meetings and collective explorations becomes a new pillar of legitimacy.

### 2.3 Creativity and Emotional Trust Capital

In an environment saturated with automated analyses, human creativity finds a differentiating role. Organizations adopting a **non-invasive approach** to cognitive augmentation (e.g., methods for stimulating divergent thinking, facilitating interpersonal collaboration) increase their attractiveness:
- **Stimulation of Creativity:** Implementation of workspaces that encourage thinking outside the box [1].
- **Emotional Trust:** The recognition of the human entity as a pivot of innovation (even amid advanced AI) nourishes an "emotional" capital that adds to purely technical aspects.

---

## 3. Levers for Transforming Existing Capital

### 3.1 Strengthen "Active Curation" and Synthesis

The value of the organization no longer rests on the retention of information but on its ability to **curate** (select, organize) and synthesize.
- **Strategic Curation:** Identify strong and weak signals, then build *meaningful transversals* in a high-velocity flow of information [2].
- **Creative Synthesis:** Generate a shared understanding between human teams and AI, avoiding duplication of work and promoting collective agility [1].

### 3.2 Cultivate Collective Metacognition

Historically, social capital was linked to trust and reputation. Now, "cognitive reputation" implies the competence to regulate and steer AI-human dynamics:
- **Metacognitive Training Projects:** Sensitize employees to self-assess their biases, manage contradictory AI feedback, and anticipate cognitive conflicts [1].
- **Self-regulation Workshops:** Encourage emotional resilience and cognitive flexibility to strengthen the relationship between humans and algorithms.

### 3.3 Explicitly Value Intuition and Tacit Knowledge

In an environment where all analytical reasoning can be driven or accelerated by AI models, implicit knowledge (intuition, field experience) acquires a dual importance:
- **Formalize the Implicit:** Organize feedback on subtle *patterns* detected and circulate these "nuggets" within the community [1].
- **Strengthen the "Contextual Awareness" Function:** The organization that mobilizes human intelligence to identify weak signals and inconsistencies in AI processing cultivates a social capital that is difficult for competitors to replicate.

---

## 4. Definition of Influence Strategies in the Era of Co-intelligence

In the pre-AI era, influence largely relied on "relational networks" and recognized expertise. Today, the **ability to orchestrate hybrid communities** must be integrated:

1. **"Cognitive Diplomacy" Strategy**
   - *Objective:* Manage human-AI interfaces on the basis of mutual respect and complementarity, while nurturing stakeholder trust [2].
   - *Practice:* Organize "co-intelligence forums" where internal teams, partners, and specialized AI meet to solve multi-sectoral problems.

2. **"Distributed Curiosity" Strategy**
   - *Objective:* Continuously stimulate the desire to experiment and share lessons learned, in order to consolidate the community around exploration.
   - *Practice:* Implement weekly "cognitive challenges," combining brief AI feedback + human brainstorming, to exercise intellectual plasticity and mutual trust.

3. **"Non-linear Convergence" Strategy**
   - *Objective:* Activate resources distributed within the organization without imposing a rigid pipeline [3].
   - *Practice:* Encourage opportunistic collaborations, where participants unite around specific projects, guided by an orchestration interface managed by a "strategic human agent" [3].

---

## 5. Construction of Frameworks for Evaluating and Managing Augmented Social Capital

### 5.1 Qualitative Indicators

- **Inter-human Coordination Index (ICI):** Measures the fluidity and clarity of communication, the degree of responsiveness, and the ability of human agents to collaborate with AI without manifest friction [1].
- **Creativity and Divergent Thinking Score:** Evaluates the frequency and quality of potentially innovative ideas from co-creation environments [1].
- **Quality of Active Curation:** Rate of use and reuse of produced syntheses, perception of relevance by project teams [2].

### 5.2 Socio-Relational Indicators

- **Participation Rate in Co-creation Workshops:** Indicates the level of actual engagement in collective activities, beyond mere presence.
- **Evaluation of Internal and External Trust:** Internal/external surveys to measure the perceived credibility and reliability of the organization as a "contributor of cognitive value."
- **Emerging Relationships Capital:** Counts the formation of new alliances, participation in external cognitive networks, or the birth of transversal projects outside the initial scope.

### 5.3 Continuous Feedback Loops

- **Cognitive Observability:** Implementation of traceability mechanisms for interactions and analysis of encouragements/brakes to collective intelligence [3].
- **Evolutive Adaptation:** Regular adjustment of methods, based on the active participation (feedback) of human users and AI performance [4].

---

## Conclusion: Towards a New Ecology of Strategic Value

The era of co-intelligence imposes a disruption of reference points: social capital is no longer limited to traditional networks and historical trust; it is now embodied in the ability to **orchestrate human collaboration and AI potential**. Organizations that can value human intuition, structure knowledge curation, and emphasize shared creativity will strengthen an "augmented" and resilient social capital.

By mastering these new levers ‚Äì inter-human and AI coordination, active curation, cognitive diplomacy, opportunistic collective intelligence ‚Äì companies can build lasting strategic influence and a competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate. The major challenge lies in the **continuity of this dynamic redefinition**: to make social capital a constantly co-evolving ecosystem, where humans and AI prosper together.
