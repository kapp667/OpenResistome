### **Text 2: Organizational Plasticity: Foundations, Obstacles, and Levers for Action**  
*Strategic and philosophical reflection on the capacity of organizations to metamorphose*

---

#### **1. Defining Organizational Plasticity**  
We often hear about "agility" in the world of work, about short cycles and lean methods. Yet, **organizational plasticity** refers to a broader and deeper reality: it is the ability of a structure to **continuously reconfigure itself** in the face of transformations in its environment, without losing its identity or fracturing from within. While agility evokes speed and flexibility of reaction, plasticity is a **coherent metamorphosis** – almost organic – relying on the collective potential of the company.

Therefore, the question is not only to "do faster" or "do better", but to **change the very form** that the organization takes, to rethink its contours, its hierarchies, its mode of governance, its values. This plasticity arises from a tension between **continuity** (preserving what makes sense, what nourishes the internal culture) and **rupture** (daring to undo routines, to question mental models).

---

#### **2. The Philosophical Roots: Evolution and Identity**  
The notion of plasticity, in the philosophical sense, refers to the **capacity for transformation** while maintaining a form of unity. It is found in the concept of "individuation" (Gilbert Simondon) or in the analogy of living organisms (the biologist Jean Piaget, for example). Companies, like living beings, must ensure their **survival** by integrating external stimuli, but also **develop** by exploring new functions.

- **Continuity of identity**: the organization does not deny itself; it maintains a certain DNA, a set of guiding principles.  
- **Morphological adaptation**: to survive (and prosper), it modifies its processes, even its *raison d'être*, without emptying itself of its substance.

In the current technological context, marked in particular by the wave of generative AI, plasticity is crucial: how to **remain oneself** while **changing profoundly**?

#### **3. Obstacles to Plasticity: Inertia and Disconnections**  
Every organization – whether a multinational, a growing SME, or a public administration – faces **forces of inertia**:

1. **Cultural heritage**: Traditions, ways of thinking, and managerial practices anchored for years can inhibit audacity and risk-taking.  
2. **Hierarchical partitioning**: Silos (services, departments) slow down the circulation of ideas and innovations, making the organization rigid.  
3. **Fear of destabilization**: Changing the structure can arouse concerns (loss of power, uncertainty about the future), and provoke more or less conscious resistance.  
4. **Comfort of the already-established**: Habit, past success, excessive confidence in a model that has proven itself, but which is no longer in phase with market changes.

Moreover, a common pitfall is to **superficially apply** a transformation (a new organization chart, an agile method) without working on the cultural and relational foundations. This pseudo-plasticity does not withstand major turbulence – such as the arrival of AI or the sudden upheaval of a market.

#### **4. Levers for Action: Interdependent Workstreams**  
In a strategic approach, several structuring workstreams can be identified to strengthen organizational plasticity:

1. **The cultural workstream:**  
   - Encourage reflective capacity: establish spaces for dialogue to question routines, debate strategic choices, and welcome errors as sources of learning.  
   - Bring to life "founding myths" that encourage openness and boldness. Some companies are nourished by internal stories that value experimentation, curiosity, and questioning.

2. **The organizational workstream:**  
   - Revisit governance: free up decision-making, encourage transversality, and reduce hierarchical barriers that hinder the flow of information.  
   - Support flexible, ephemeral, or permanent forms of cooperation (project teams, task forces, internal labs), allowing reconfiguration according to the needs of the moment.

3. **The skills workstream:**  
   - Develop "cognitive flexibility": train employees in critical thinking, creativity, and understanding of AI logic, without requiring them to become technical experts.  
   - Focus on the porosity of roles: an employee who changes departments or experiments with cross-functional missions develops their resilience, while creating bridges between different areas of activity.

4. **The long-term culture workstream:**  
   - Accept that the transformation is not completed in a six-month "project", but is nourished by permanent adjustment loops.  
   - Articulate the quest for immediate results (market obligations, concrete deliverables) and the prospective vision (anticipating AI scenarios in five or ten years).

#### **5. The Encounter between Plasticity and AI: An Opportunity for Profound Mutation**  
The arrival of generative AI tools is not limited to a gain in productivity or new functionalities. It can act as a **stimulus** that tests the organization's plasticity. In an optimistic scenario:

- Employees are encouraged to **learn** and **question** the technology: "What can it do for me? For my team? What limits should we impose on ourselves?"  
- Management supports "laboratories" or "pilot spaces" where teams take ownership of the tools, experiment, and share their discoveries.  
- The corporate culture values **transversality**: novice AI users work alongside those who master the tool better, which creates skill exchanges.

On the contrary, in a "rigid" scenario, AI risks remaining confined to one department, or being artificially grafted without modifying practices in depth. The company then deprives itself of the catalytic force that this technology would bring, and may lose in competitiveness or attractiveness in the long term.

#### **6. A Strategic and Human Perspective: Thinking about the Individual, the Collective, and Meaning**  
Beyond organizational schemes, plasticity involves **human support**. Employees must be able to:  
- **Understand** the reason for these changes: why does the company want to adopt AI? What new horizons does this open up?  
- **Appropriate** the changes: explore new roles, cooperate with AI assistants without fearing for their jobs or their legitimacy.  
- **Contribute** to the definition of the rules of use (ethics, attitude towards automation, the question of data protection), so as not to be subjected to decisions taken "from above".

This human dimension joins a **philosophical** concern: how to keep meaning in work in the era of increasing automation? Organizational plasticity, if it is done with respect for the human condition, can become a **catalyst for fulfillment** and **creativity**, rather than a source of anxiety.

#### **7. Conclusion: Better Understanding Plasticity, Anticipating the Future**  
Faced with current technological upheavals, organizational plasticity appears as a **strategic asset**. More than a fashionable managerial concept, it is a **process**: one by which a company, large or small, public or private, continuously reinvents its operating methods, reshuffles its internal cards, and redefines its vision.

This capacity for evolution carries within it a promise: to preserve a **coherence** between **identity** and **innovation**. In the universe of AI, where each new development can challenge entire markets or create unprecedented opportunities, plasticity becomes a **criterion for survival** and excellence.

Ultimately, understanding and cultivating plasticity requires thinking both about **dynamic adaptation** (what I modify immediately) and **projection** (how do I project myself into the future?). It is in this dialectical movement, which marries the stability of history with the flexibility of possibilities, that the organization discovers its true room for maneuver – and, perhaps, its **destiny** in the age of artificial intelligence.
