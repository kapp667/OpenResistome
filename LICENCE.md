# Open Reasoning Dataset License v0.1

**Read, share, use, cite. No modification, no privatization. AI & collective intelligence are welcome.**

## Preamble

This license, inspired by the [Resistome Manifesto](insert_link_to_manifesto) and movement, aims to promote free access, sharing, and ethical use of knowledge in the age of Artificial Intelligence. It's a tool for **human cognitive resistance**, designed to protect the **integrity of reasoning** while fostering **human-machine co-intelligence**. By adopting this license, you join a community dedicated to building an **open, integrated, and resilient critical thinking dataset**. We believe that **atomicity of reasoning** - preserving the original form of arguments - is crucial for **constructive dissensia** and the **long-term evolution of ideas**. This license encourages the creation of an **open and collaborative decentralized ecosystem of thought**, where human and artificial intelligence can collaborate to **align AI with humanity long term interests**.

## Permissions

You are hereby granted, free of charge, the right to **read**, **share**, **use**, and **cite** the Work. This includes, without limitation, the rights to use the Work in reasoning processes (including with AI), to include the Work in datasets, to create links to the Work, and to quote the Work in other works.

## Restrictions

*   **Integrity of the Original Work**: **Modification** of the original Work is **not permitted**. This restriction is intended to preserve the atomicity of the reasoning process, ensuring that each Work remains a coherent and traceable unit of thought. See the "Note on Atomicity and Dissensia" below.
*   **No Privatization**: The Work must not be used for purposes of knowledge privatization, manipulation, disinformation, or any other practice contrary to the principles of cognitive resilience and autonomy promoted by the #Resistome manifesto.
*   **Attribution and Linking**: Any use of the Work, including quotations, inclusion in a dataset, or use by an AI, must clearly mention its original source, including the author's name (if available), this license, **AND include a functional hyperlink to a complete and accessible version of the original Work, or, failing that, precise and reliable instructions for accessing it. The location of the original Work should be stable and permanent.**

## Note on Atomicity, Dissensia and Reasoning Graphs

The #Resistome movement believes that complex reasoning is best understood and analyzed as a collection of interconnected, yet distinct, arguments. Each Work under this license is intended to represent an **atomic unit of reasoning**, a coherent set of ideas that should be considered as a whole.

**Reasoning graphs** are a key tool for this movement. They operate on **separate layers** linked to atomic units (original texts, annotations, and comments) **and not within the texts themselves.** This is essential for maintaining a **multidimensional traceability of reasoning** and fostering **constructive "dissensia" - the productive confrontation of differing viewpoints.**

While the original text of a Work cannot be modified, **reasoning graphs allow for a dynamic interaction with and around it**. They enable:

*   **Mapping the structure of arguments** within a Work and between different Works.
*   **Linking Works to annotations, critiques, and rebuttals**, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected ideas.
*   **Visualizing areas of agreement and disagreement**, thus promoting a nuanced understanding of complex issues.
*   **Facilitating human-machine collaboration**, where AI can analyze and generate arguments within the graph structure, guided by human insight.

**This approach, based on atomicity and dissensia, mirrors the open-source philosophy but adapts it to the specific requirements of reasoning and critical thinking.** It fosters a **distributed and collaborative critical thinking process**, where each contribution builds upon others without altering the original expression of an idea. It aims to create a **resilient, adaptable, and ever-evolving ecosystem of thought**, resistant to manipulation and centralized control, where human and artificial intelligence can collaborate to enhance understanding and decision-making.
