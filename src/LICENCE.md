# Open License #Resistome

**Read, share, use, cite. No modification, no privatization. AI & collective intelligence are welcome.**

## Preamble

This license, inspired by the [Technopirate Manifesto](insert_link_to_manifesto) and the #Resistome movement, aims to promote free access, sharing, and ethical use of knowledge. It encourages human-machine co-intelligence and the building of an open, integrated, and resilient critical thinking dataset.

## Permissions

You are hereby granted, free of charge, the right to **read**, **share**, **use**, and **cite** the Work. This includes, without limitation, the rights to use the Work in reasoning processes (including with AI), to include the Work in datasets, to create links to the Work, and to quote the Work in other works.

## Restrictions

*   **Integrity of the Original Work**: **Modification** of the original Work is **not permitted**. This restriction is intended to preserve the atomicity of the reasoning process, ensuring that each Work remains a coherent and traceable unit of thought. See the "Note on Atomicity" below.
*   **No Privatization**: The Work must not be used for purposes of knowledge privatization, manipulation, disinformation, or any other practice contrary to the principles of cognitive resilience and autonomy promoted by the #Resistome movement.
*   **Attribution and Linking**: Any use of the Work, including quotations, inclusion in a dataset, or use by an AI, must clearly mention its original source, including the author's name (if available), this license, **AND include a functional hyperlink to a complete and accessible version of the original Work, or, failing that, precise and reliable instructions for accessing it. The location of the original Work should be stable and permanent.**

## Note on Atomicity

The #Resistome movement believes that complex reasoning is best understood and analyzed as a collection of interconnected, yet distinct, arguments. Each Work under this license is intended to represent an **atomic unit of reasoning**, a coherent set of ideas that should be considered as a whole.

Modifying the original text would risk disrupting the internal logic and coherence of the argument, making it harder to trace the author's thought process and potentially leading to misinterpretations or distortions.

Instead of modifying the original, we encourage the creation of **separate, linked Works** such as:

*   **Annotations**: Comments, critiques, and elaborations linked to specific parts of the original Work.
*   **Rebuttals**: Counter-arguments presented as distinct Works, linked to the original.
*   **Reasoning Graphs**: Visual representations of the argument's structure, linking the Work to related ideas and critiques.
*   **Annotated Versions**: Separate publications that integrate the original Work with commentary, corrections, or expansions, while keeping the original text intact and clearly distinguishable.

This approach fosters a **distributed and collaborative critical thinking process**, where each contribution builds upon others without altering the original expression of an idea.

## No Warranty

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.
